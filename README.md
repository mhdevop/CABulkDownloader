## NOTES
Just a few things to consider before using:

- My code is not "modular" or in a "function" which it very well could/should be
- Major credit to pspete for amazing PowerShell modules: https://github.com/pspete/
- Make sure you edit ALL the variables at the top of the script to match your environment
- Check for any "Change me" items in the script for your environment
- Support/development of this script could be minimal so don't expect a lot
